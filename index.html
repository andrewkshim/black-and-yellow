            <h3>Matty</h3>
            <p>I tell professional data scientists how to teach data science, for a living. And then after that, I manage the students to make sure they're enjoying their experience. So working with many different personality types comes naturally to me. Though you wouldn't guess it by how tall I am, I have little athletic ability, though I can dance in any style and to any song. Hopefully, my intelligence and knowledge of the show will compensate for that!</p>

              <h3>Shimmy</h3>
              <p>A maker at heart, Andrew loves building things from scratch and venturing into the unknown. On most weekends, he’ll be hacking away at something, but his dog will occasionally pull him away from the computer and take him on a hike. He currently lives in Oakland, CA with his college roommate, his nature-loving dog, and his two grumpy cats. He’s been forced to adopt a fashion trend called “Fur-ever 21”.</p>
